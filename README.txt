============================
Group EriDev implement this proof of concept course project using  Spring MVC.
We have tried to use the spring security, but unfortunately we had a hard time to implement it.

A result we hard coded for login process.

=============================

When you select the login from the navbar in the landing page, it will lead to the login page. 
Then, simply hit the login button and it will open a page to display item in the system assumed you are the admin.
and the admin's functionality.

=============================
To switch to customer mode, type  http://localhost:8080/e-mart/customer/products/list and you will see list of products
and the customers functionality. 

=============================
This project runs on JDK 8 with MySQL 8 of dialect 5 or 8.

===========================

We have also include internationalization for the purpose of demo, 
only for the category menu of the products(on the the left of the admin and customer pages)
